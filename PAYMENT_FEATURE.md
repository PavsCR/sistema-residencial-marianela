# Payment History Feature - Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

✅ **Database Schema**
- Added `Pago` (Payment) model to Prisma schema
- Fields include: monto (amount), descripcion (description), fechaPago (payment date), metodoPago (payment method), comprobante (receipt number)
- Linked to Casa (House) model via foreign key
- Created and applied migration: `20251020221019_add_pagos_table`

✅ **Backend API**
- Created `/backend/src/routes/pagos.ts` with 3 endpoints:
  - `GET /api/pagos/mi-casa` - Get payment history for logged-in user's house
  - `GET /api/pagos/casa/:numeroCasa` - Get payment history for specific house (admin)
  - `POST /api/pagos` - Create new payment (admin)
- Registered routes in `app.ts`
- Payments are ordered chronologically (most recent first)

✅ **Frontend Component**
- Updated `/frontend/src/mis-pagos/MisPagos.tsx` with full functionality
- Created `/frontend/src/mis-pagos/MisPagos.css` with professional styling
- Features:
  - Displays house number and payment status badge
  - Shows summary statistics (Total Paid, Number of Payments, Last Payment)
  - Lists all payments in chronological order (newest first)
  - Each payment card shows: amount, date, description, payment method, receipt number
  - Currency formatting in Costa Rican Colones (CRC)
  - Date formatting in Spanish
  - Responsive design
  - Loading and error states
  - Empty state when no payments exist

✅ **Sample Data**
- Created seed script to populate 10 sample payments for Casa 100
- Payments span from January to October 2025
- Mix of payment methods: transferencia, efectivo, tarjeta
- Includes regular monthly payments and one extraordinary payment

## How it works

1. User navigates to "Mis Pagos" section
2. Frontend calls `GET /api/pagos/mi-casa`
3. Backend retrieves user's casa (house) information
4. Backend queries all payments for that casa, ordered by date descending
5. Frontend displays the data in an attractive, chronological list

## Current Status

⚠️ **Temporary Authentication Bypass**
- Authentication is temporarily disabled for testing
- Currently hardcoded to show payments for Super Admin (Casa 100)
- TODO: Re-enable `authenticateToken` middleware after implementing login system
- TODO: Use actual JWT token from `localStorage.getItem('token')`

## Test the Feature

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/
2. Click on "Mis Pagos" in the navigation
3. You should see:
   - Casa 100 information with "Al Día" status
   - 3 summary cards showing statistics
   - 10 payment cards in chronological order
